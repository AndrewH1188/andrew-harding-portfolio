  <!-- Photography About -->
  <p class="photography-about">
    My photography is much like my illustration, when I started out I was using film and the natural image,
    then as times changed this become digital, and the rise of Adobe
    Photoshop allowed image manipulation and touching up have become a factor as part of this
    process. Whilst studying photography at Croydon College I was able to photograph many urban and
    rural locations and add these to my image bank, then as part of the project I would manipulate
    and edit these to create an ideal location. Featured below are a small selection of the many photos that I have
    taken.

        <p class="card-text">
          As part of studying at London Metropolitan University, we were able to use a pinhole camera.
          We were taught about double exposure that could be done using this camera in order to achieve
          creative images. I selected a few different locations around Aldgate East and experimented
          with the double exposure of the camera. I had to wait for the film to be developed before I
          was able to see the results. When I received the photos back and looked through them I was
          happy with the results that I had managed to capture. I was glad to be able to use a camera
          like this that is now considered as old technology in comparison to newer cameras and even
          smart phones.

        <h6 class="card-title">Photo Manipulation</h6>
        <p class="card-text">
          When I studied photography whilst at Croydon College we were given the task to manipulate images.
          I decided to use images that I'd taken with others that I'd found online, edit and mix them
          together to create the above photos. I decided to use recognisable landmarks such as the London
          Eye, the Gherkin and Canary Wharf as a way to showcase my partial London origins, as I was born
          in South London. I also decided to use these landmarks to see how they would look being taken out
          of their current and familiar locations. These images certainly give the viewer something to
          think about.

          Using some of the Star Wars micro builds I decided to put these on an astronomy calendar as a
          backdrop to celebrate Star Wars day on May 4th and 5th. I used the models to show the good
          using with the lighter background, and the bad with the darker background as well as slightly
          darkening the photo on my iPhone. I held the models that have the cotton to make them appear as
          if they are flying whilst capturing the image. With the below images I decided to integrate the
          figures with everyday life. I have many of these scenes that have been completed and intended to
          use these on my Little World of Lego site, but didn't have time to edit these ready to be used on
          the products featured on my site.

          In order to showcase the products that GJ Electronics were selling they required photos of them.
          GJ Electronics would send samples of their products and I would photograph them and then edit them.
          The editing would consist of removing the background and replacing this with a plain white background,
          stitching images together as well as change colours so that all images with different colours would
          have the same angle and layout. These product images were used in Newsletters, Brochures, Catalogues,
          Packaging
          and across the various websites that are owned and managed by GJ Electronics.
