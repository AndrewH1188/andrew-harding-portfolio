        <p class="about-page-text">
          I spent two years studying Graphic Design with Print Making as a side study at Croydon College.
          I graduated from Croydon College with a Triple Distinction (3x A Levels) in Graphic Design and
          went on to learn new skills as well as further my knowledge and skills whilst studying Graphic Design
          at London Metropolitan University. During my three years studying at London Metropolitan University I
          decided to learn Photography and Illustration as a side study. I was very much against the machine with
          the illustration so would illustrate by hand.

        <p class="about-page-text">
          After five years of studying, I started my Graphic Design career with Richards Asssociates
          (a small local company) as an intern, this was only a few weeks after graduating from
          University. Richards Asssociates is where I had completed work experience with during the
          break from leaving school, before going to College. Whilst being an intern working at Richards
          Associates I studied at SCOLA (Sutton College of Learning for Adults) in the evenings to help
          my Adobe InDesign, Illustrator, Photoshop, Flash and Dreamweaver skills progress further.
          Whilst attending SCOLA I also studied basic HTML and CSS as this is what was on the job spec
          and I had no knowledge of at the time. I completed my internship with Richards Associates and
          was taken on as a full time Graphic Designer. Here I would not only work for some of the big
          names in the conferencing business, but gain more skills and on the job knowledge as well as
          work as part of the most amazing team I could have wished to work with.

        <p class="about-page-text">
          After moving up north to be with family I started working at Home Bargains as a sales assistant
          whilst I was looking for another role in a Graphic Design company. Whilst I was at Home Bargains
          I helped team members and even undertook junior management responsibilities.

        <p class="about-page-text">
          After applying to various companies with Graphic Design vacancies I was able to get a role with a
          local Graphic Design firm. Here I would further my existing skills and learn new skills in Graphic
          Design as well as be able to do some photography and illustration. I changed companies throughout
          this time picking up new design and business skills and was able to use my existing skills to
          complete various tasks for various industries and clients that we worked with. I would also go on
          to work as a printer which helped understand the process as well as how outcomes are printed, and
          what can't be printed due to complexity and machine ability.

        <p class="text-muted mb-2 fw-bold">June 2020 - Present</p>
        <p class="about-page-text">
          I have previously volunteered with Marie Curie and St Raphael's Hospice as part of my Duke of
          Edinburgh's Award Gold Service and continued after I had completed this section. I wanted to
          get back into volunteering, and during the pandemic I saw an advert in the Quiet magazine that
          the British Tinnitus Association publish asking for help as a volunteer befriender. I read the
          details of the ad and applied, I like volunteering and wanted to give back to a charity that has
          helped me before. I was excited to be accepted and continue 2 years (2022) later to continue
          helping and supporting others through the British Tinnitus Association.

        <p class="about-page-text">
          Due to the pandemic and job uncertainty I decided to enrol with Learning People Global who are
          partnered with Code Institute to learn to code, not only because this in demand, but also
          having worked with websites and web design it would seem natural to use my existing skills and
          branch out to new ventures. Having successfully completed the course at the middle of April, I
          have since been looking for a role as a Developer. If you have an open role for
          a Developer and would like to take a look at my
