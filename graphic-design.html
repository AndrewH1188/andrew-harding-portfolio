  <!-- Graphic Design About -->
  <p class="graphic-design-about">
    The projects showcased are just a small selection from my career in Graphic Design which spans 12 years.
    During this time I've managed to build a vast portfolio of work for various clients across varying industries and
    businesses,
    as well as learn the Adobe InDesign, Adobe Illustrator and Adobe Photoshop software to develop my skills, learning
    from others,
    as well as sharing this knowledge with others to help them. It is safe to say that from my original creations and
    designs that like
    a fine wine time can do great things, the taste like my creative ability gets better.

        <p class="card-text">I wanted something that I could write on to say thank you for sponsoring me for undertaking
          the Memory Walks in aid of Alzheimers Society.
          I designed these cards to hand write in and as a personal touch to express my thanks to the sponsors for their
          support.
          I chose and had printed the three different designs that I photographed and are shown above.

        <h6 class="card-title">Wings of Glory Roller Banners</h6>
        <p class="card-text">
          Wings of Glory Aerodrome required roller banners that they could use when attending events.
          The purpose was to use striking images so that this would make them stand out and entice people
          to participate in the game. I was asked to find images on Google that showed British war planes
          attacking the Luftwaffe planes as this was for the UK Wing (UK group). I used the images that
          were found and blended colour from the image so that it gave a bit of colour to the top and
          bottom of the banners, this allowed the white text they wanted to be clearly and easily seen and
          read.

        <p class="card-text">
          As part of showcasing the new and existing products and promotions I have made many banners for
          the Mountech home page carousel. With many of the product images I have to get these from the
          manufacturers site. I will then use the brand colours so that the customer can associate and
          relate with what is shown to them. With the length of seconds each banner is displayed for an
          appropriate snappy or quickly readable message is required to tell customers exactly what this is
          about. Last of all a call to action (CTA) is added inviting them to learn more about the product
          on display.

        <p class="card-text">
          GJ Electronics had a good image of the HDMI cables that were in packaging, but the packaging was a bit
          outdated as we had redesigned their look. Using the original packaging photo that they had I made a
          design in Adobe Illustrator, then used Adobe Photoshop to show how the design would look when this was
          printed. GJ Electronics were happy with this design and had another HDMI cable that was new and wanted
          something similar to the new design. They requested a change in colours so that customers could
          differentiate between the original HDMI cable and the Active cable easily.
