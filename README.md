# Andrew Harding's Portfolio

My Portfolio site showcases my Coding, Graphic Design and Developer skills to potential employers. This also gives me a site to house all of my work as some jobs that I have applied for ask for only one link, which is a bit problematic when I have four links. This site addresses and solves this problem. Also I can show off my Graphic Design skills which I will be able to bring to and use in my new role.

## Showcase

A deployed live version of my Portfolio website can be found [here](https://andrewh1188.github.io/andrew-harding-portfolio/)

This domain link will allow you to access my live deployed website for my Portfolio. I have created this as part of my job search in order to showcase to employers my skills, as well as to continue coding and keep my new studied skills fresh, problem solve and learn from the challenges along the way to help make me a better Developer. 

My Portfolio site has been designed to be responsive across all platforms. The original designs kept this factor in mind and also encompasses the simple, clean, appealing and effective look and feel. I used my very colourful CV as the influence in colour choice that has been used and to tie this together with my CV creating continuity across my self brand. This is a skill that would be applied in any area of design and also showcases further still the Graphic Design traits that I have many years experience both study and working in.

## User Experience UX
My portfolio site allows the viewer to easily understand what my site is about as there is the text on the home page that welcomes them. This helps cement the fact that this is a portfolio site and the navigation supports this with the portfolios dropdown link. For all pages a back to top button has been added so that the user doesn't have to scroll from the bottom all the way back to the top, but simply use the button to help them do this effectively and efficiently. Everything from informing the user to the device friendly layout has been done with the end user in mind.

## User Stories
* Understand the site's purpose and what it is I am looking to achieve with this site.
* Navigate to specific pages easily and efficiently.
* Understand a brief history about Andrew both work and study wise.
* Easily see the various kinds of work in the categories and have something to tell me a bit behind the thinking/process.
* Be able to link externally to coded sites and repositories easily.
* Contact easily should they have a vacant role or a message that they would like to send across.
* Be able to connect, like and follow social media pages.
* See other repositories and portfolio sites that have been completed.

## Site Goals
* Provide potential employers with a taste of what I am about and can do.
* Provide an easy to navigate, understand and use site that gives the potential employers a hassle free experience.
* Provide a way that can extend the reach to potential employers.
* Be the one link that can be added to a job site so that I don't have to choose which site to showcase to potential employers.
* Show off my personal brand and have something that my CV can be matched to with colours, fonts etc.

## Construction Planes
## Strategy
The strategy when constructing my Portfolio site was to be able to use the colours, fonts and some work mentioned on my CV to be able to tie both together. A branded CV and a branded portfolio that both work hand in hand.

## Scope
The features and main parts that are on the table for production are:
* Home page
* About page
* Coding page
* Graphic Design page
* Illustration page
* Photography page
* Contact page
* 404 page
I hope that with the information provided on the home page, that this gives the users a clear understanding of what my portfolio site has to offer them. With the site cleanly laid out and the navigation there for users to be able to use I would hope that this reinforces the above too.

## Structure
All information displayed has been logically grouped with the right content on the right pages. This helps a user to find what they are looking for on the page that they have clicked into as they will know from the link that the content shown is what they would expect to see.
The about page has a brief timeline of work and study history, the portfolio pages have the correct content to match the titles, the home has a showcase of images in the carousel and a bit about why the site has been created and the contact page has the simple relevant boxes that allow a user to contact me. 
The structure of my site allows users to quickly navigate from the home page to their chosen page using the nav bar at the top of the page. Also on the Home page and About page there are links to other pages within my site. On the home page when hire is clicked this links you to the Contact page. When the carousel banner is clicked these link to you the different portfolio pages. In the About page there are links to the Coding page and again Contact page. Once on the Coding page a user is able to visit the live site and my repository for this. With the contact form and back to top button this further adds interactivity that the user can click within the page to do something. The last piece that a user can interact with is the Social Media and Portfolio icons, when clicked these take you to the Page, Group, Portfolio or Repository. Here a user can like, follow, connect, comment, view and further reach out to me. Accessibility throughout my site will be included for people that have visual impairments and use a screen reader. With everything mentioned above this shows the users of my Portfolio site that I have them in mind through the design of my site and have made it as user friendly as possible.

## Skeleton
All information (as mentioned in the Structure plane) has been grouped into the relevant category. This is so that when a user clicks the link in the nav bar, they get the meets the user expectations and and give the user a great experience. 

## Surface
My finished site will match the colours of my CV and have some of the information that is based on my CV expanded. I will use the same font as my CV. I will also use icons from Font Awesome that have also been used on my CV and with all the above will tie the two documents together, although one being my CV will be static, whereas my site will be an interactive piece for the viewer to navigate round. I will keep the top bar as the nav bar (or on my CV it is the information bar that holds my name, contact details GitHub and LinkedIn links). My site will use my name on the left the same as my CV, but on the right will have the nav links. The links to my GitHub and LinkedIn along with other Social media will be placed in the footer. This will help with the clean look, feel and layout of my site and again tie into my CV. I will use a similar font to my CV for my online portfolio. The font that I will use is called Poppins and is on [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Poppins?query=poppins). With the clean font, matching colours to my CV and user friendliness of my site there can be no mistake in connecting both my CV and site to each other and understanding that each are there to work alongside each other for the same outcome/goal.

## Design
As my site is a portfolio with different works and methods of creativity, from Coding through to Photography, I decided to give each a page with the relevant content. It was hard to pick the various images as I have such a large creative portfolio from many years of work.

The original mock designs that I produced in [Adobe InDesign](https://www.adobe.com/uk/products/indesign.html) can be found below:

## Imagery
##### Favicon:
I created the favicon that I have used using my initials AH in [Adobe Illustrator](https://www.adobe.com/uk/products/illustrator.html). I then exported this out as a jpg from there and uploaded this for use as part of my site.

##### Coding Carousel image and page banner:

Although the Error 404 image was downloaded from [Adobe Stock](https://stock.adobe.com/uk/) I coloured this vector image so this was the same as my site.

## Features
## Existing-features
* The user is able to get a good feel of my portfolio site and what it has to offer them from the home page. The carousel gives the user a brief preview about my portfolio site with the various images that are relate to the portfolio categories.
* The user is able to use either the carousel images or the nav bar to navigate their way to the different portfolio sections.
* Users are able to navigate to the contact page by clicking the 'hire' text link in the welcome text section that tells them what, how, why the site was created and what I would like to achieve from this.
* The navigation bar enables a user to see the current page that they are on and navigate through to other pages effortlessly and with ease.
* The about page tells the user a brief bit about me and walks the user from the start of my studies at college through to some of the various companies that I have worked at. Also this has links to my Coding portfolio and to contact me should they like what they see and want to know more.
* The Coding page allows users to explore my live sites as well as take a look at the code behind the scenes in my repository.
* Users are able to contact me by filling out the form on the contact page and pressing the send button. They are notified that their message has been successfully sent and that I will endeavour to reply to them as soon as possible.
* The Social Media icons in the footer allow users to access easily my various Social Media channels. Here they are able to follow, add, like and comment as well as stay up to date with any posts that I put on these.
* My portfolio site can be accessed on different devices. 

## Future-features
My plan for this portfolio site is to break it out into separate websites. One will be a Coding only site with all of my coding portfolio and showcasing all of the individual sites that makeup my Coding portfolio, whilst the other site will be focused on my Design background. I will still keep this site and add to the Coding page with other portfolio sites that I complete along the way. Breaking this site out into separate sites I believe will give employers a better understanding / feel of what I can do coding wise and not overpower this with my design experience as this is showcased within the sites that I have produced and will continue to produce.

## Technologies and Languages Used
### Languages
* [HTML5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5) for the markup language to construct the site and content.
* [CSS3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS) to help style the content on the pages, as well as help with the layout.
* [JavaScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript)to help features to work as expected and add extra working features.
* [jQuery](https://jquery.com/) to help features to work as expected and add extra working features.

## Libraries Frameworks and Online Resources Used
* [Google Chrome Dev Tools](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/): For testing purposes and to see why elements are not working as expected. Dev tools allowed me to make changes to my code in the browser to see a live representation of my website / service with the changes / amends that have been made.
* [Lighthouse](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse/overview/): Was used for testing my website / service for Performance, Accessibility, Best Practices and Search Engine Optimisation (SEO). I have tested as before on my portfolio the different categories mentioned above on both mobile applications and computer applications and have loaded the screenshots of the results in the [testing](TESTING.md) section.
* [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/): Google Fonts was used to find a suitable font as well as to import this font into my website / service. The font that I decided to use as it was clean, stylish and fitting is called Spartan which is displayed on all pages on my website / service throughout the project. This is to keep styles consistent throughout my website / service.
* [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.6/getting-started/introduction/): For help with styling and layout of my portfolio site.
* [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/): The Font Awesome Icons that I have used have been listed below:
* [Hamburger Bars icon](https://fontawesome.com/v5/icons/bars?style=solid&s=solid&f=classic)
* [Study icon](https://fontawesome.com/icons/graduation-cap?s=solid&f=classic)
* [Work icon](https://fontawesome.com/icons/user-tie?s=solid&f=classic)
* [Shop icon](https://fontawesome.com/icons/store?s=solid&f=classic)
* [Volunteer icon](https://fontawesome.com/icons/hand-holding-heart?s=solid&f=classic)
* [Facebook icon](https://fontawesome.com/v5/icons/facebook-f?style=brands&s=solid&f=brands)
* [LinkedIn icon](https://fontawesome.com/icons/linkedin?s=&f=brands)
* [Instagram icon](https://fontawesome.com/v5/icons/instagram?style=brands&s=solid&f=brands)
* [Twitter icon](https://fontawesome.com/v5/icons/twitter?style=brands&s=solid&f=brands)
* [Adobe Behance icon](https://fontawesome.com/icons/square-behance?s=&f=brands)
* [GitHub icon](https://fontawesome.com/icons/square-github?s=&f=brands)
* [Tiny PNG](https://tinypng.com/): Again my friend Tiny PNG was used to compress the file size of all images without losing any of the original image quality or distorting the images in any way. This is so that when the pages are loaded the images do not slow down the loading speed and therefore make this user-friendly, as well as reduces the bounce rate of users viewing and clicking off the pages.
* [EmailJS](https://www.emailjs.com/): used in order to hook up my contact section to my email. This is so that I am able to receive, questions or feedback from the users that have interacted with my site / service.

## Tools
* [GitPod](https://www.gitpod.io/) was used to write my code as well as paste in code from Bootstrap. In GitPod I was also able to amend the code from Bootstrap as well as create and style code in both HTML and CSS. I was able to add images to the folders that I created, as well as files to contain the code. In GitPod I was also able to (using python3 -m http.server) view my web page in the browser in a separate tab, allowing me to use the inspect section in Google Dev Tools to inspect elements and see what worked, as well as what didn’t work and amend this accordingly.
* [Git](https://git-scm.com/): Git was used for version control having set up the GitPod Terminal to commit and push saved changes and commits to GitHub.
* [GitHub](https://github.com/): GitHub was used to store the saved changes from my project after being pushed from Git.
* [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/): was used to create the initial wireframes and amend them to reflect the new feature(s)

## Programmes
* [Adobe InDesign](https://www.adobe.com/uk/products/indesign.html) was used to create the design mock up of the site using colours, images, setting the text and layout. I used Adobe InDesign to do this so that I had something that I could use as a final and a visual as to how the final would look. I exported the final design as an Adobe Acrobat PDF so that I could easily view my intended site design. I also exported these designs as jpgs so that these could be stored in the designs file on GitPod and shown in my README.md file.
* [Adobe Illustrator](https://www.adobe.com/uk/products/illustrator.html) was used to create the favicon.
* [Adobe Photoshop](https://www.adobe.com/uk/products/photoshop.html) was used to scale the banner images on the various pages as well as add the text and coloured curved corner boxes for the carousel.

## Other Resources
* [W3C HTML-validator](https://validator.w3.org/): used to find errors in my HTML code as well as implement the suggestions to fix these.
* [Jigsaw](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/): used to find errors in my CSS code as well as implement the suggestions to fix these.
* [JS Hint](https://jshint.com/): for my JavaScript to see if there are any errors and use the feedback to fix these.
* [Am I Responsive](https://ui.dev/amiresponsive) was used for the screenshot of the mock up which is at the top in my README.md file and also to show off my site my different social media platforms.
Google Chrome Developer Tools was used to test sizes, check responsiveness and view the layouts as well as debug errors and problems I encountered along the way.
* [Prettier.io](https://prettier.io/) was used to make my CSS look neat, tidy and easier to follow / read.
* [Onlinespellcheck.com](https://www.online-spellcheck.com/) I have run my README.md through here to check for any spelling or grammar errors.

## Social Media
With all of my projects I have included the Social Media pages, groups etc and this one is no exception to this rule. I used my own Social Media channels, but have introduced my Adobe Behance and GitHub portfolios into my Portfolio site. I introduced both of these as links so that employers could see previous work in either code or graphic design that I have completed or am working on.
The Social Media channels / pages are all as listed below:
* [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/AndrewHardingFullStackWebDeveloper)
* [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-harding-coder)
* [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/andrewh1188/)
* [Twitter](https://twitter.com/andrewh1188?s=21&t=t6-HtguZVHz7MbNRaVFGiQ)

## Portfolio Sites
This is a new feature that I decided to add. I wanted employers to be able to explore my skills further and so added the portfolio sites of Behance and GitHub so that they are able to.
* [Adobe Behance](https://www.behance.net/Andrew_Harding)
* [GitHub](https://github.com/AndrewH1188)

## Bugs
### Bugs Fixed
* No back to top button on the Illustration page. This was because the code was cut to put oon a page instead of copied. After the code was replaced the back to the top button showed and functioned as it should.

* When I looked on my iPad the nav links were closer to my name, but weren't on my Mac. This was caused by looking at the live site on my iPad that was due to be added, committed and pushed, whereas on my Mac I was viewing the site haviing used python3 -m http.server. Once the add, commit and push were completed and the live view refreshed on my iPad all was as I expected it to look.
* Adobe Behance icon in the footer and War Heroes Remembered Code Institute portfolio project link didn't work when clicked on. Once the links were updated they both worked as expected.
* I tried to add a 123 Reg domain name to my portfolio project so that this had a more professional feel to it. I was unfortunately not able to do this. I decided not to go any further with this because of the complications and use the .github.io link instead. Reverting back meant that there were problems when I came to add, commit and push my site. GitHub was saying to me that the push couldn't be completed and that I should do a Git pull. As there was nothing to pull I did a hard delete to restore / reset to a previous commit. I made the changes that I needed in the code then did the git add, commit and push and this all worked fine again.

### Known Bugs
There are no known bugs that I am aware of.

## Testing
Testing can be found [here](TESTING.md)

## Deployment
Deployment:
In order to create this website I used GitPod to write the code, upload and store images and all relevant files that were required for this website to function, as well as show the testing, bugs, a live version of the deployed site which have been added to my README.md file to showcase these. As GitPod is linked to GitHub when I wrote my code I was able to use the terminal in GitPod to add, commit and push the code and any changes to their server. My project has been deployed using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) which has allowed my site to go live for people to use and view.
My portfolio site is another part of my expanding portfolio that employers are able to view and see my coding skills and also my design skills. Having a live deployed site enables users to view my site without having to fork or clone this for themselves, but if users would rater clone my site for themselves I have added a section below to walk them through how to do this.
The below are the following steps I took to deploy my website and make this live:
1. Click on the Repositories tab in GitHub.
2. Click on the andrew-harding-portfolio link which is at the top of my repositories. This is here as it is the most recent file I have been working on.
3. Click the settings tab.
4. Scroll all the way down near the bottom to [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) which now has its own dedicated tab.
5. Click the Check it out, which will take you to GitHub Pages.
6. Where it says Source, click the dropdown and set this to master.
7. Click save and then wait a few minutes before clicking on the link to view your live masterpiece.

You are more than welcome to run this project locally yourself, and if you would like to do this you will need to do the following:
1. Click on the andrew-harding-portfolio link which is at the top of my Repository in GitHub.
2. Click on the dropdown arrow where it says Code.
3. Click Clone, Open GitHub Desktop or Download ZIP.
4. Open in your preferred IDE.
5. Run on your preferred server.


#### EmailJS set up:


Using EmailJS will allow you as the website designer and coder to link your contact form to send emails through to your email address. This is simple to set up. If you would also like to use EmailJS on your form on your project then please follow the simple steps below:
1. Go to this [web address](https://www.emailjs.com/) and click the Sign Up Free if you don’t have an EmailJS account already.
2. If you haven’t got an account with EmailJS you need to sign up. You will be directed to this [page](https://dashboard.emailjs.com/sign-up).
3. Upon sign up you will be taken to the [Email Services](https://dashboard.emailjs.com/admin) page. On this page you will see the + Add New Service button. Click this and you will see a list of email provider services and their logos. Select the email provider/service that you want to connect your email too.
If you’re using Gmail you can connect your Gmail account to this service and send a test email to make sure this is connected (the test box has a tick auto enabled so this will send on your behalf when you click the Create Service button). Whereas if you’re using anything else like AOL, iCloud, Outlook or Yahoo you will need to put in your email address and a password. When connecting your email you will see a Service ID, this will need to be copied as you will require this later.
4. Under Email Services you will then see your mail service logo and name with your service code, so if you didn’t copy this when you input your email please copy this now and place this safe in your JavaScript file as you will require this in your code to set up your code talking to this service.
5. In the list on the left-hand side select [Email Templates](https://dashboard.emailjs.com/admin/templates) to get your email template set up. When you click here you will see it has a button that says + Create New Template. Click this or the Press [Create New Template](https://dashboard.emailjs.com/admin/templates/new) to create your first template!
6. Now you are able to customise what you want your template to say as well as give it a name. Once you have done select the save in the top right-hand corner. Once you have saved this you will see The template has been added successfully appear in the top middle of the screen.
7. To test the template and see if this is connected to your email you will then need to select Test It which is in the top right hand corner near the Save button.
8. You will be able to fill in the form and then press the Send Test Email button. One thing to note is that above the Send Test Email button there is the following:
* Javascript Code
* emails.send(“service_27qba4y”,”template_opwbfyr”);
You will need to also copy and save this somewhere (like your JavaScript file as you will need this later. In the template that you have edited to suit your requirements be sure to go to the settings and give this a name. The Template ID needs to be left as it is, so please do not change this part.
9. So you have now set up your template and tested that this works with your email, you are now able to add in the code from EmailJS into your own JavaScript file. To do this head over to the [Integration](https://dashboard.emailjs.com/admin/integration/npm) section on the left-hand panel and select the [Browser](https://dashboard.emailjs.com/admin/integration/browser) button under the Integration title and next to the NPM button. 
 If you would like to add the JavaScript in then there is some to get you started in the Playground section. This will allow you to see the JavaScript that you will need to add to your JavaScript file. I decided that as EmailJS had the code for the CSS, HTML and JavaScript that I would borrow theirs and credit them for this as it worked and sped up the development time for this part of my project.

## Content
All content on my website / portfolio has been written by myself apart from the quote which is by Stuart Crang at Learning People Global. 

All media and imagery that is on my site is my own apart from the images in the carousel, portfolio page banners and the error 404 image. I have added to these or amended them in a slight way. These ways of amending are by adding the different coloured shape with the text in and colouring of the 404 image as mentioned in the [imagery](#imagery) section.

There is some content that I have used from previous Code Institute Milestone Projects as well as from [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/getting-started/introduction/)

## Media
Some images were purchased and downloaded from [Adobe Stock](https://stock.adobe.com/uk/). Other images were downloaded from [Pixabay](https://pixabay.com/) and have their respected links to the image source in the [Imagery](#imagery) section of my README.md document 

## Acknowledgments
I would like to start of by thanking as always my Mum. Thank you for your belief, help, support, understanding and just for being there. Without you there to help in the ways that you can I wouldn't have been able to have done any of this without you. THANK YOU MUM. 

Thank you to Stuart Crang at the Learning People Global for your help, support, and continuous coffee related material. Here's to you good sir ☕. 

I would also like to thank Jim and Susie Jenner for their help and support even though they still don't really know how I do what I do, but are intrigued to hear about my progress nevertheless.

Thank you to Auntie Julie and Uncle Danny for your support along the way and for your feedback too.

Thank you to all at Planet Rock for keeping me company with great music and DJs whilst I code away.
