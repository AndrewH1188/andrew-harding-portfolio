### About
* Tested links in the about text section take the user to the right page.

### Coding
* Tested links in the coding text section take the user to the right page.

### Contact

### User Stories







### Implementation
My Portfolio site has been coded and designed to meet three needs. 
1. The first is to continue using the coding skills and knowledge that I have learned whilst studying with Code Institute in order to build a fully functional site. 
2. The second is to showcase my diverse portfolio of Coding, Graphic Design, Illustration and Photography skills to prospective employers and anyone else that views my site. 
3. The third is to have one link that encompasses all of my portfolios within a portfolio site. This will help when adding the link to the Website box part of the job application section. As I have four links from my Code Institute Milestone Projects this has been previously difficult to pick from. Thinking of my portfolio site as Lord of the Rings this is the “One link to rule them all”. My portfolio addresses all three of the needs mentioned above and gives you as the user a little taste of what I am about, what I can do, what I have been up to.

With all the second tests that I conducted (after amending the code because of the validator suggestions and tips) I noticed that whilst some results stay the same and others improve. There are other results that haven't and have gone down. I had to run the second Lighthouse testing in incognito mode as there were issues affecting this. This is the only reason that I could put the negative change in results down to. 

### Validators
### HTML Validator
When I originally ran my code through the W3C HTML validator I had some issues. the issues highlighted to me were:

1. Unclosed div in the nav section.
2. Unclosed section tag in the footer.
3. Script tags outside of the body.

After I'd corrected these mistakes and ran this through the W3C HTML validator I was only left with 3 warnings. These warnings relate to the EmailJS code that I took from EmailJS itself. I looked at amending this so that the W3C validator would be ok with the code that it saw. I tested the form with the type="script/javascript" removed but the form didn't work, so I have had to leave this in.

### Jigsaw CSS Validator
When I first tested my CSS I had two warnings that I had done. There are other warnings but these are coming from Bootstrap.

After removing the depreciated media feature the validator showed no errors that I had done.

#### JSHint
When I tested the JavaScript Code through JSHint I had the following results:

### Drop-down Menu
![Drop-down Menu 1](assets/images/validator/jshint-menu-dropdown-1.jpg)
After running the JavaScript code through JSHint I saw that I needed the semicolon at the end to the line.

![Drop-down Menu 2](assets/images/validator/jshint-menu-dropdown-2.jpg)
After adding the semicolon at the end and re running the validator this outcome was ok.

### Carousel
![Carousel 1](assets/images/validator/jshint-carousel-1.jpg)
After running the JavaScript code through JSHint I saw that I needed the semicolon at the end to the line.
