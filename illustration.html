  <!-- Illustration About -->
  <p class="illustration-about">
    From a young age I have always drawn by hand, and having studied illustration at London Metropolitan University
    I decided to opt for the original form and meaning of word illustration. Here I have been able to use these skills,
    and with the progress in my Adobe Illustrator skills, this has allowed me to produce illustrated images and line
    drawings.
    Featured below are a small selection of my original illustrations as well as line drawings that have been done
    digitally in Adobe Illustrator.

          Studying the different people (apart from the Queen who was in the Metro Newspaper) on the tube as
          I made my way to London Metropolitan University. This gave me something to do, practice my skills
          and experiment with different techniques. This also allowed me to use these characters in my
          illustrated story that we made as part of the illustration module.

        <p class="card-text">
          The illustrations that I have completed above are again as part of practicing my hand drawn
          illustration skills. I decided to look at Games Workshop and Disney characters and draw the
          Crocodile, Jester and River Troll. I practiced using pencil to caricature my college tutor,
          although didn't get the mouth right so have yet to finish this. My cow illustration is based
          on my Bronze Expedition that I completed as part of the Duke of Edinburgh's Award. I expanded
          this as a painting during after school Art Club and the teachers liked it so much they put it
          in the staff room as they liked it and it cheered them up.

        <h6 class="card-title">Fish Illustrations</h6>
        <p class="card-text">
          Practicing with Adobe Illustrator I decided to create some fish as they are quite simple
          and easy to do. I thought I would use varying colours as a gradient on all of the fish.
          The gradient helps to show a bit of contrast and some shadow too. I decided to stretch
          out the original shape of the larger orange fish in order to and compress this down to
          form the other fish that are on the page. With a change in colour gradients this made
          them differ slightly from the others that are there.

        <h6 class="card-title">The Glassman</h6>
        <p class="card-text">
          I was asked by a glass repairer if I could use the Glassman font and image from Google but make this
          high res for their business. I took the black and white image and traced round this, then added the
          effects to make this look more like a shard of glass. The glass repairer liked all of three of the
          images, but decided the first image was their favourite as it looked more glass like.
